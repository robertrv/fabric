It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number of
servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (regular
python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'

This is called remote automation, and the primary use case is deploying
applications to multiple similar hosts.

Although it is easier to automate when the target hosts are similar, it is not
a requirement and Fabric has features for working with heterogeneous hosts as
well.

Once installed, you can run `fab help` to learn more about how to use Fabric.
